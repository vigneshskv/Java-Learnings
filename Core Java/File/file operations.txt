# File IO:
  1. File
  2. FileWriter
  3. FileReader
  4. BufferedWriter
  5. BufferedReader
  6. PrintWriter
  
File:
------
  '''file f = new file("file_path.extension");'''
  This creates a new file object.
  NOTE: This doesnt create physical file, rather just creates object and if the file_path already exists then just points to 
    the file.
