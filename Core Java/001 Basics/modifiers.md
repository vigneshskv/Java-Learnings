# Access Control Modifiers #
Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods and constructors. The four access levels are âˆ’

= Visible to the package, the `default`. No modifiers are needed.
- Visible to the class only (`private`).
- Visible to the world (`public`).
- Visible to the package and all subclasses (`protected`).

# Non-Access Modifiers #
Java provides a number of non-access modifiers to achieve many other functionality.
- The `static` modifier for creating class methods and variables.
- The `final` modifier for finalizing the implementations of classes, methods, and variables.
- The `abstract` modifier for creating abstract classes and methods.
- The `synchronized` and `volatile` modifiers, which are used for threads.
